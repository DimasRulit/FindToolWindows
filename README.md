# FindToolWindows

A tool to search for files throughout the windows system.

The program uses an indexed database in which the data corresponds to every path and file in Windows.

Right now the database has only a name and a path. Later I added indexes to find the fastest possible detection.

This tool will be constantly in demand. Perhaps someone will contribute.


Currently using the CustomTkinter library and others:

# HOW TO USE

1. Run index.py
2. Wait for indexing of all files on your system
3. File_index.db should appear next to index.py
4. run main.py
5. Enjoy the speed of your search!

# You can also download compiled files. You can run them without installing libraries or python.
