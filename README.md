# FindToolWindows

A tool to search for files throughout the windows system.

The program uses an indexed database in which the data corresponds to every path and file in Windows.

Right now the database has only a name and a path. Later I added indexes to find the fastest possible detection.

This tool will be constantly in demand. Perhaps someone will contribute.


Currently using the CustomTkinter library and others:
