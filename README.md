The program uses an indexed database in which the data corresponds to every path and file in Windows.

Right now the database has only a name and a path. Later I added indexes to find the fastest possible discovery.

This tool will be constantly updated. Perhaps someone can help with this.

Currently using the CustomTkinter library and others:.

# HOW TO USE

1. Run index.py
2. Wait for indexing of all files on your system
3. File_index.db should appear next to index.py
4. run main.py
5. Enjoy the speed of your search!

# LMB - open found file. RMB - open file path



# You can also download compiled files. You can run them without installing libraries or python.


# Please offer your ideas and how to implement more useful features.


At this stage, there are problems with the search.
