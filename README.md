The program uses an indexed database in which the data corresponds to every path and file in Windows.

Right now the database has only a name and a path. Later I added indexes to find the fastest possible discovery.

This tool will be constantly updated. Perhaps someone can help with this.

Currently using the CustomTkinter library and others:.

5. Enjoy the speed of your search!

# LMB - open found file. RMB - open file path



# You can also download compiled files. You can run them without installing libraries or python.

# HOW TO USE COMPILED FILES

1. Extract files from .zip file
2. place index.exe near main.exe in extracted files

# Please offer your ideas and how to implement more useful features.


At this stage, there are problems with the search.
